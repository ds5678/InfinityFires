I know many people might skip over this, but I hope you don't. You are so special, and I would appreciate your support. Modding takes lots of time, and I have expenses like food, internet, and rent. If you feel that I have improved your playing experience, please consider supporting me on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ds5678). Your support helps to ensure that I can continue making mods for you at the pace I am :)
